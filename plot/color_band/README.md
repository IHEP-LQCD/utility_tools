### Example plot with advanced features
---
These examples come from the figures shown in paper [arXiv:2012.06228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06228),
where we use color boxes to show the final results in different $J^{PC}$ channels,
and use color band to indicate the fitting range and fitting results with best fit parameters.

> Note: change `png` format to whatever format you like when `savefig`.
